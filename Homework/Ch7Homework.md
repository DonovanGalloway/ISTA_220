13.  Consider this quote by Alexander Stepanov:
I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras — families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting — saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all.
Who is Alexander Stephanov? What do you think about this quote? 
nothing is true, everything is permitted.
