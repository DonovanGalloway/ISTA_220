1.  How do you define a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments? Declare the method using the param keyword.

3.  How do you call a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments? you use the method.
4.  Why canâ€™t you use an array to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a method? you can however it creates more work.
5.  How many parameters can a method have? as many as you want to give it.
6.  Do parameter arguments have to have the same type? No
7.  What is the difference between a method that takes a parameter argument and one that takes optional arguments? optional parameters still take a fixed parameter list, and you cannot pas an arbitrary list of arguments; a parameter argument has a completely arbitrary list of parameters and none of them has a default value. 
8.  How do you define a method that takes different (and arbitrary) types of arguments? use the object keyword.
