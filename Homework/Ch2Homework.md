1. How do you turn a string into an integer? Use the method called Int32.Parse to convert a string value to an integer. Pg.45 Tip Box
1. What is the difference between precedence and associativity? Give an example where this makes a difference. Precedence: governs the order in which an expressionsâ€™ operators are evaluated. Pg.52		Associativity: the direction (left to right) in which operands of an operator are evaluated. Pg.53		10/5*10
1. What is the definite assignment rule? A rule in C# that states that every variable must have a value before being read from.
1. How are the prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators evaluated differently? ++ adds 1 to the value, -- subtracts 1 from the value. Pg.55
